the
hunger
games
the
hunger
games
by
suzanne
collins
part
i
the
tributes
when
i
wake
up
the
other
side
of
the
bed
is
cold
my
fingers
stretch
out
seeking
prims
warmth
but
finding
only
the
rough
canvas
cover
of
the
mattress
she
must
have
had
bad
dreams
and
climbed
in
with
our
mother
of
course
she
did
this
is
the
day
of
the
reaping
i
prop
myself
up
on
one
elbow
theres
enough
light
in
the
bedroom
to
see
them
my
little
sister
prim
curled
up
on
her
side
cocooned
in
my
mothers
body
their
cheeks
pressed
together
in
sleep
my
mother
looks
younger
still
worn
but
not
so
beaten
down
prims
face
is
as
fresh
as
a
raindrop
as
lovely
as
the
primrose
for
which
she
was
named
my
mother
was
very
beautiful
once
too
or
so
they
tell
me
sitting
at
prims
knees
guarding
her
is
the
worlds
ugliest
cat
mashed
in
nose
half
of
one
ear
missing
eyes
the
color
of
rotting
squash
prim
named
him
buttercup
insisting
that
his
muddy
yellow
coat
matched
the
bright
flower
i
he
hates
me
or
at
least
distrusts
me
even
though
it
was
years
ago
i
think
he
still
remembers
how
i
tried
to
drown
him
in
a
bucket
when
prim
brought
him
home
scrawny
kitten
belly
swollen
with
worms
crawling
with
fleas
the
last
thing
i
needed
was
another
mouth
to
feed
but
prim
begged
so
hard
cried
even
i
had
to
let
him
stay
it
turned
out
okay
my
mother
got
rid
of
the
vermin
and
hes
a
born
mouser
even
catches
the
occasional
rat
sometimes
when
i
clean
a
kill
i
feed
buttercup
the
entrails
he
has
stopped
hissing
at
me
entrails
no
hissing
this
is
the
closest
we
will
ever
come
to
love
i
swing
my
legs
off
the
bed
and
slide
into
my
hunting
boots
supple
leather
that
has
molded
to
my
feet
i
pull
on
trousers
a
shirt
tuck
my
long
dark
braid
up
into
a
cap
and
grab
my
forage
bag
on
the
table
under
a
wooden
bowl
to
protect
it
from
hungry
rats
and
cats
alike
sits
a
perfect
little
goat
cheese
wrapped
in
basil
leaves
prims
gift
to
me
on
reaping
day
i
put
the
cheese
carefully
in
my
pocket
as
i
slip
outside
our
part
of
district
nicknamed
the
seam
is
usually
crawling
with
coal
miners
heading
out
to
the
morning
shift
at
this
hour
men
and
women
with
hunched
shoulders
swollen
knuckles
many
who
have
long
since
stopped
trying
to
scrub
the
coal
dust
out
of
their
broken
nails
the
lines
of
their
sunken
faces
but
today
the
black
cinder
streets
are
empty
shutters
on
the
squat
gray
houses
are
closed
the
reaping
isnt
until
two
may
as
well
sleep
in
if
you
can
our
house
is
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
seam
i
only
have
to
pass
a
few
gates
to
reach
the
scruffy
field
called
the
meadow
separating
the
meadow
from
the
woods
in
fact
enclosing
all
of
district
is
a
high
chain
link
fence
topped
with
barbed
wire
loops
in
theory
its
supposed
to
be
electrified
twenty
four
hours
a
day
as
a
deterrent
to
the
predators
that
live
in
the
woods
packs
of
wild
dogs
lone
cougars
bears
that
used
to
threaten
our
streets
but
since
were
lucky
to
get
two
or
three
hours
of
electricity
in
the
evenings
its
usually
safe
to
touch
even
so
i
always
take
a
moment
to
listen
carefully
for
the
hum
that
means
the
fence
is
live
right
now
its
silent
as
a
stone
concealed
by
a
clump
of
bushes
i
flatten
out
on
my
belly
and
slide
under
a
two
foot
stretch
thats
been
loose
for
years
there
are
several
other
weak
spots
in
the
fence
but
this
one
is
so
close
to
home
i
almost
always
enter
the
woods
here
as
soon
as
im
in
the
trees
i
retrieve
a
bow
and
sheath
of
arrows
from
a
hollow
log
electrified
or
not
the
fence
has
been
successful
at
keeping
the
flesh
eaters
out
of
district
inside
the
woods
they
roam
freely
and
there
are
added
concerns
like
venomous
snakes
rabid
animals
and
no
real
paths
to
follow
but
theres
also
food
if
you
know
how
to
find
it
my
father
knew
and
he
taught
me
some
before
he
was
blown
to
bits
in
a
mine
explosion
there
was
nothing
even
to
bury
i
was
eleven
then
five
years
later
i
still
wake
up
screaming
for
him
to
run
even
though
trespassing
in
the
woods
is
illegal
and
poaching
carries
the
severest
of
penalties
more
people
would
risk
it
if
they
had
weapons
but
most
are
not
bold
enough
to
venture
out
with
just
a
knife
my
bow
is
a
rarity
crafted
by
my
father
along
with
a
few
others
that
i
keep
well
hidden
in
the
woods
carefully
wrapped
in
waterproof
covers
my
father
could
have
made
good
money
selling
them
but
if
the
officials
found
out
he
would
have
been
publicly
executed
for
inciting
a
rebellion
most
of
the
peacekeepers
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
few
of
us
who
hunt
because
theyre
as
hungry
for
fresh
meat
as
anybody
is
in
fact
theyre
among
our
best
customers
but
the
idea
that
someone
might
be
arming
the
seam
would
never
have
been
allowed
in
the
fall
a
few
brave
souls
sneak
into
the
woods
to
harvest
apples
but
always
in
sight
of
the
meadow
always
close
enough
to
run
back
to
the
safety
of
district
if
trouble
arises
district
twelve
where
you
can
starve
to
death
in
safety
i
mutter
then
i
glance
quickly
over
my
shoulder
even
here
even
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
you
worry
someone
might
overhear
you
when
i
was
younger
i
scared
my
mother
to
death
the
things
i
would
blurt
out
about
district
about
the
people
who
rule
our
country
panem
from
the
far
off
city
called
the
capitol
eventually
i
understood
this
would
only
lead
us
to
more
trouble
so
i
learned
to
hold
my
tongue
and
to
turn
my
features
into
an
indifferent
mask
so
that
no
one
could
ever
read
my
thoughts
do
my
work
quietly
in
school
make
only
polite
small
talk
in
the
public
market
discuss
little
more
than
trades
in
the
hob
which
is
the
black
market
where
i
make
most
of
my
money
even
at
home
where
i
am
less
pleasant
i
avoid
discussing
tricky
topics
like
the
reaping
or
food
shortages
or
the
hunger
games
prim
might
begin
to
repeat
my
words
and
then
where
would
we
be
in
the
woods
waits
the
only
person
with
whom
i
can
be
myself
gale
i
can
feel
the
muscles
in
my
face
relaxing
my
pace
quickening
as
i
climb
the
hills
to
our
place
a
rock
ledge
overlooking
a
valley
a
thicket
of
berry
bushes
protects
it
from
unwanted
eyes
the
sight
of
him
waiting
there
brings
on
a
smile
gale
says
i
never
smile
except
in
the
woods
hey
catnip
says
gale
my
real
name
is
katniss
but
when
i
first
told
him
i
had
barely
whispered
it
so
he
thought
id
said
catnip
then
when
this
crazy
lynx
started
following
me
around
the
woods
looking
for
handouts
it
became
his
official
nickname
for
me
i
finally
had
to
kill
the
lynx
because
he
scared
off
game
i
almost
regretted
it
because
he
wasnt
bad
company
but
i
got
a
decent
price
for
his
pelt
look
what
i
shot
gale
holds
up
a
loaf
of
bread
with
an
arrow
stuck
in
it
and
i
laugh
its
real
bakery
bread
not
the
flat
dense
loaves
we
make
from
our
grain
rations
i
take
it
in
my
hands
pull
out
the
arrow
and
hold
the
puncture
in
the
crust
to
my
nose
inhaling
the
fragrance
that
makes
my
mouth
flood
with
saliva
fine
bread
like
this
is
for
special
occasions
mm
still
warm
i
say
he
must
have
been
at
the
bakery
at
the
crack
of
dawn
to
trade
for
it
what
did
it
cost
you
just
a
squirrel
think
the
old
man
was
feeling
sentimental
this
morning
says
gale
even
wished
me
luck
well
we
all
feel
a
little
closer
today
dont
we
i
say
not
even
bothering
to
roll
my
eyes
prim
left
us
a
cheese
i
pull
it
out
his
expression
brightens
at
the
treat
thank
you
prim
well
have
a
real
feast
suddenly
he
falls
into
a
capitol
accent
as
he
mimics
effie
trinket
the
maniacally
upbeat
woman
who
arrives
once
a
year
to
read
out
the
names
at
the
leaping
i
almost
forgot
happy
hunger
games
he
plucks
a
few
blackberries
from
the
bushes
around
us
and
may
the
odds
he
tosses
a
berry
in
a
high
arc
toward
me
i
catch
it
in
my
mouth
and
break
the
delicate
skin
with
my
teeth
the
sweet
tartness
explodes
across
my
tongue
be
ever
in
your
favor
i
finish
with
equal
verve
we
have
to
joke
about
it
because
the
alternative
is
to
be
scared
out
of
your
wits
besides
the
capitol
accent
is
so
affected
almost
anything
sounds
funny
in
it
i
watch
as
gale
pulls
out
his
knife
and
slices
the
bread
he
could
be
my
brother
straight
black
hair
olive
skin
we
even
have
the
same
gray
eyes
but
were
not
related
at
least
not
closely
most
of
the
families
who
work
the
mines
resemble
one
another
this
way
thats
why
my
mother
and
prim
with
their
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
always
look
out
of
place
they
are
my
mothers
parents
were
part
of
the
small
merchant
class
that
caters
to
officials
peacekeepers
and
the
occasional
seam
customer
they
ran
an
apothecary
shop
in
the
nicer
part
of
district
since
almost
no
one
can
afford
doctors
apothecaries
are
our
healers
my
father
got
to
know
my
mother
because
on
his
hunts
he
would
sometimes
collect
medicinal
herbs
and
sell
them
to
her
shop
to
be
brewed
into
remedies
she
must
have
really
loved
him
to
leave
her
home
for
the
seam
i
try
to
remember
that
when
all
i
can
see
is
the
woman
who
sat
by
blank
and
unreachable
while
her
children
turned
to
skin
and
bones
i
try
to
forgive
her
for
my
fathers
sake
but
to
be
honest
im
not
the
forgiving
type
gale
spreads
the
bread
slices
with
the
soft
goat
cheese
carefully
placing
a
basil
leaf
on
each
while
i
strip
the
bushes
of
their
berries
we
settle
back
in
a
nook
in
the
rocks
from
this
place
we
are
invisible
but
have
a
clear
view
of
the
valley
which
is
teeming
with
summer
life
greens
to
gather
roots
to
dig
fish
iridescent
in
the
sunlight
the
day
is
glorious
with
a
blue
sky
and
soft
breeze
the
foods
wonderful
with
the
cheese
seeping
into
the
warm
bread
and
the
berries
bursting
in
our
mouths
everything
would
be
perfect
if
this
really
was
a
holiday
if
all
the
day
off
meant
was
roaming
the
mountains
with
gale
hunting
for
tonights
supper
but
instead
we
have
to
be
standing
in
the
square
at
two
oclock
waiting
for
the
names
to
be
called
out
we
could
do
it
you
know
gale
says
quietly
what
i
ask
leave
the
district
run
off
live
in
the
woods
you
and
i
we
could
make
it
says
gale
i
dont
know
how
to
respond
the
idea
is
so
preposterous
if
we
didnt
have
so
many
kids
he
adds
quickly
theyre
not
our
kids
of
course
but
they
might
as
well
be
gales
two
little
brothers
and
a
sister
prim
and
you
may
as
well
throw
in
our
mothers
too
because
how
would
they
live
without
us
who
would
fill
those
mouths
that
are
always
asking
for
more
with
both
of
us
hunting
daily
there
are
still
nights
when
game
has
to
be
swapped
for
lard
or
shoelaces
or
wool
still
nights
when
we
go
to
bed
with
our
stomachs
growling
i
never
want
to
have
kids
i
say
i
might
if
i
didnt
live
here
says
gale
but
you
do
i
say
irritated
forget
it
he
snaps
back
the
conversation
feels
all
wrong
leave
how
could
i
leave
prim
who
is
the
only
person
in
the
world
im
certain
i
love
and
gale
is
devoted
to
his
family
we
cant
leave
so
why
bother
talking
about
it
and
even
if
we
did
even
if
we
did
where
did
this
stuff
about
having
kids
come
from
theres
never
been
anything
romantic
between
gale
and
me
when
we
met
i
was
a
skinny
twelve
year
old
and
although
he
was
only
two
years
older
he
already
looked
like
a
man
it
took
a
long
time
for
us
to
even
become
friends
to
stop
haggling
over
every
trade
and
begin
helping
each
other
out
besides
if
he
wants
kids
gale
wont
have
any
trouble
finding
a
wife
hes
good
looking
hes
strong
enough
to
handle
the
work
in
the
mines
and
he
can
hunt
you
can
tell
by
the
way
the
girls
whisper
about
him
when
he
walks
by
in
school
that
they
want
him
it
makes
me
jealous
but
not
for
the
reason
people
would
think
good
hunting
partners
are
hard
to
find
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
ask
we
can
hunt
fish
or
gather
lets
fish
at
the
lake
we
can
leave
our
poles
and
gather
in
the
woods
get
something
nice
for
tonight
he
says
tonight
after
the
reaping
everyone
is
supposed
to
celebrate
and
a
lot
of
people
do
out
of
relief
that
their
children
have
been
spared
for
another
year
but
at
least
two
families
will
pull
their
shutters
lock
their
doors
and
try
to
figure
out
how
they
will
survive
the
painful
weeks
to
come
we
make
out
well
the
predators
ignore
us
on
a
day
when
easier
tastier
prey
abounds
by
late
morning
we
have
a
dozen
fish
a
bag
of
greens
and
best
of
all
a
gallon
of
strawberries
i
found
the
patch
a
few
years
ago
but
gale
had
the
idea
to
string
mesh
nets
around
it
to
keep
out
the
animals
on
the
way
home
we
swing
by
the
hob
the
black
market
that
operates
in
an
abandoned
warehouse
that
once
held
coal
when
they
came
up
with
a
more
efficient
system
that
transported
the
coal
directly
from
the
mines
to
the
trains
the
hob
gradually
took
over
the
space
most
businesses
are
closed
by
this
time
on
reaping
day
but
the
black
markets
still
fairly
busy
we
easily
trade
six
of
the
fish
for
good
bread
the
other
two
for
salt
greasy
sae
the
bony
old
woman
who
sells
bowls
of
hot
soup
from
a
large
kettle
takes
half
the
greens
off
our
hands
in
exchange
for
a
couple
of
chunks
of
paraffin
we
might
do
a
tad
better
elsewhere
but
we
make
an
effort
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
greasy
sae
shes
the
only
one
who
can
consistently
be
counted
on
to
buy
wild
dog
we
dont
hunt
them
on
purpose
but
if
youre
attacked
and
you
take
out
a
dog
or
two
well
meat
is
meat
once
its
in
the
soup
ill
call
it
beef
greasy
sae
says
with
a
wink
no
one
in
the
seam
would
turn
up
their
nose
at
a
good
leg
of
wild
dog
but
the
peacekeepers
who
come
to
the
hob
can
afford
to
be
a
little
choosier
when
we
finish
our
business
at
the
market
we
go
to
the
back
door
of
the
mayors
house
to
sell
half
the
strawberries
knowing
he
has
a
particular
fondness
for
them
and
can
afford
our
price
the
mayors
daughter
madge
opens
the
door
shes
in
my
year
at
school
being
the
mayors
daughter
youd
expect
her
to
be
a
snob
but
shes
all
right
she
just
keeps
to
herself
like
me
since
neither
of
us
really
has
a
group
of
friends
we
seem
to
end
up
together
a
lot
at
school
eating
lunch
sitting
next
to
each
other
at
assemblies
partnering
for
sports
activities
we
rarely
talk
which
suits
us
both
just
fine
today
her
drab
school
outfit
has
been
replaced
by
an
expensive
white
dress
and
her
blonde
hair
is
done
up
with
a
pink
ribbon
reaping
clothes
pretty
dress
says
gale
madge
shoots
him
a
look
trying
to
see
if
its
a
genuine
compliment
or
if
hes
just
being
ironic
it
is
a
pretty
dress
but
she
would
never
be
wearing
it
ordinarily
she
presses
her
lips
together
and
then
smiles
well
if
i
end
up
going
to
the
capitol
i
want
to
look
nice
dont
i
now
its
gales
turn
to
be
confused
does
she
mean
it
or
is
she
messing
with
him
im
guessing
the
second
you
wont
be
going
to
the
capitol
says
gale
coolly
his
eyes
land
on
a
small
circular
pin
that
adorns
her
dress
real
gold
beautifully
crafted
it
could
keep
a
family
in
bread
for
months
what
can
you
have
five
entries
i
had
six
when
i
was
just
twelve
years
old
thats
not
her
fault
i
say
no
its
no
ones
fault
just
the
way
it
is
says
gale
madges
face
has
become
closed
off
she
puts
the
money
for
the
berries
in
my
hand
good
luck
katniss
you
too
i
say
and
the
door
closes
we
walk
toward
the
seam
in
silence
i
dont
like
that
gale
took
a
dig
at
madge
but
hes
right
of
course
the
reaping
system
is
unfair
with
the
poor
getting
the
worst
of
it
you
become
eligible
for
the
reaping
the
day
you
turn
twelve
that
year
your
name
is
entered
once
at
thirteen
twice
and
so
on
and
so
on
until
you
reach
the
age
of
eighteen
the
final
year
of
eligibility
when
your
name
goes
into
the
pool
seven
times
thats
true
for
every
citizen
in
all
twelve
districts
in
the
entire
country
of
panem
but
heres
the
catch
say
you
are
poor
and
starving
as
we
were
you
can
opt
to
add
your
name
more
times
in
exchange
for
tesserae
each
tessera
is
worth
a
meager
years
supply
of
grain
and
oil
for
one
person
you
may
do
this
for
each
of
your
family
members
as
well
so
at
the
age
of
twelve
i
had
my
name
entered
four
times
once
because
i
had
to
and
three
times
for
tesserae
for
grain
and
oil
for
myself
prim
and
my
mother
in
fact
every
year
i
have
needed
to
do
this
and
the
entries
are
cumulative
so
now
at
the
age
of
sixteen
my
name
will
be
in
the
reaping
twenty
times
gale
who
is
eighteen
and
has
been
either
helping
or
single
handedly
feeding
a
family
of
five
for
seven
years
will
have
his
name
in
forty
two
times
you
can
see
why
someone
like
madge
who
has
never
been
at
risk
of
needing
a
tessera
can
set
him
off
the
chance
of
her
name
being
drawn
is
very
slim
compared
to
those
of
us
who
live
in
the
seam
not
impossible
but
slim
and
even
though
the
rules
were
set
up
by
the
capitol
not
the
districts
certainly
not
madges
family
its
hard
not
to
resent
those
who
dont
have
to
sign
up
for
tesserae
gale
knows
his
anger
at
madge
is
misdirected
on
other
days
deep
in
the
woods
ive
listened
to
him
rant
about
how
the
tesserae
are
just
another
tool
to
cause
misery
in
our
district
a
way
to
plant
hatred
between
the
starving
workers
of
the
seam
and
those
who
can
generally
count
on
supper
and
thereby
ensure
we
will
never
trust
one
another
its
to
the
capitols
advantage
to
have
us
divided
among
ourselves
he
might
say
if
there
were
no
ears
to
hear
but
mine
if
it
wasnt
reaping
day
if
a
girl
with
a
gold
pin
and
no
tesserae
had
not
made
what
im
sure
she
thought
was
a
harmless
comment
as
we
walk
i
glance
over
at
gales
face
still
smoldering
underneath
his
stony
expression
his
rages
seem
pointless
to
me
although
i
never
say
so
its
not
that
i
dont
agree
with
him
i
do
but
what
good
is
yelling
about
the
capitol
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
it
doesnt
change
anything
it
doesnt
make
things
fair
it
doesnt
fill
our
stomachs
in
fact
it
scares
off
the
nearby
game
i
let
him
yell
though
better
he
does
it
in
the
woods
than
in
the
district
gale
and
i
divide
our
spoils
leaving
two
fish
a
couple
of
loaves
of
good
bread
greens
a
quart
of
strawberries
salt
paraffin
and
a
bit
of
money
for
each
see
you
in
the
square
i
say
wear
something
pretty
he
says
flatly
at
home
i
find
my
mother
and
sister
are
ready
to
go
my
mother
wears
a
fine
dress
from
her
apothecary
days
prim
is
in
my
first
reaping
outfit
a
skirt
and
ruffled
blouse
its
a
bit
big
on
her
but
my
mother
has
made
it
stay
with
pins
even
so
shes
having
trouble
keeping
the
blouse
tucked
in
at
the
back
a
tub
of
warm
water
waits
for
me
i
scrub
off
the
dirt
and
sweat
from
the
woods
and
even
wash
my
hair
to
my
surprise
my
mother
has
laid
out
one
of
her
own
lovely
dresses
for
me
a
soft
blue
thing
with
matching
shoes
are
you
sure
i
ask
im
trying
to
get
past
rejecting
offers
of
help
from
her
for
a
while
i
was
so
angry
i
wouldnt
allow
her
to
do
anything
for
me
and
this
is
something
special
her
clothes
from
her
past
are
very
precious
to
her
of
course
lets
put
your
hair
up
too
she
says
i
let
her
towel
dry
it
and
braid
it
up
on
my
head
i
can
hardly
recognize
myself
in
the
cracked
mirror
that
leans
against
the
wall
you
look
beautiful
says
prim
in
a
hushed
voice
and
nothing
like
myself
i
say
i
hug
her
because
i
know
these
next
few
hours
will
be
terrible
for
her
her
first
reaping
shes
about
as
safe
as
you
can
get
since
shes
only
entered
once
i
wouldnt
let
her
take
out
any
tesserae
but
shes
worried
about
me
that
the
unthinkable
might
happen
i
protect
prim
in
every
way
i
can
but
im
powerless
against
the
reaping
the
anguish
i
always
feel
when
shes
in
pain
wells
up
in
my
chest
and
threatens
to
register
on
my
ace
i
notice
her
blouse
has
pulled
out
of
her
skirt
in
the
back
again
and
force
myself
to
stay
calm
tuck
your
tail
in
little
duck
i
say
smoothing
the
blouse
back
in
place
prim
giggles
and
gives
me
a
small
quack
quack
yourself
i
say
with
a
light
laugh
the
kind
only
prim
can
draw
out
of
me
come
on
lets
eat
i
say
and
plant
a
quick
kiss
on
the
top
of
her
head
the
fish
and
greens
are
already
cooking
in
a
stew
but
that
will
be
for
supper
we
decide
to
save
the
strawberries
and
bakery
bread
for
this
evenings
meal
to
make
it
special
we
say
instead
we
drink
milk
from
prims
goat
lady
and
eat
the
rough
bread
made
from
the
tessera
grain
although
no
one
has
much
appetite
anyway
at
one
oclock
we
head
for
the
square
attendance
is
mandatory
unless
you
are
on
deaths
door
this
evening
officials
will
come
around
and
check
to
see
if
this
is
the
case
if
not
youll
be
imprisoned
its
too
bad
really
that
they
hold
the
reaping
in
the
square
one
of
the
few
places
in
district
that
can
be
pleasant
the
squares
surrounded
by
shops
and
on
public
market
days
especially
if
theres
good
weather
it
has
a
holiday
feel
to
it
but
today
despite
the
bright
banners
hanging
on
the
buildings
theres
an
air
of
grimness
the
camera
crews
perched
like
buzzards
on
rooftops
only
add
to
the
effect
people
file
in
silently
and
sign
in
the
reaping
is
a
good
opportunity
for
the
capitol
to
keep
tabs
on
the
population
as
well
twelve
through
eighteen
year
olds
are
herded
into
roped
areas
marked
off
by
ages
the
oldest
in
the
front
the
young
ones
like
prim
toward
the
back
